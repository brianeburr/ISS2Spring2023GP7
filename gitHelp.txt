-- Some Helpful Git Commands --

Some general Linux commands are helpful to know for using command-line git:

  $ cd [DESTINATION] :		changes the current working directory to whatever is specified in [DESTINATION]

On top of some standard Linux commands, git also has its own standalone commands for source control:

  $ git add -A :		adds all new files in the local repository to tracking

  $ git commit -am [MESSAGE] :	commits all file changes to local repository
	the specified [MESSAGE] is what is sent to the global repo as the commit message

  $ git pull :			merges global repo files with local repo (updates your machine)

  $ git push :			merges local repo files with global repo (updates online repo)

  $ git status :		assesses the status of the local repo
	alerts the user of untracked files, merge conflicts, etc.
